# Introduction

## What is Systems Development?

Welcome to the exciting world of Systems Development! Now, you may be wondering, "What exactly is Systems Development?" In simple terms, it's the art and science of creating software solutions to solve problems or meet specific needs. It's like building a house but for software. You need a blueprint, materials (code, in our case), and builders (developers) to make it all happen. 

## Importance in Modern Business

In our digital age, you'll be hard-pressed to find a business that doesn't rely on software in some form or another. Whether it's an app that lets you order food with a few taps or complex software managing global supply chains, software systems power today's world. Understanding how to develop these systems is more than just coding; it involves a holistic understanding of problem-solving, planning, teamwork, and maintenance. 

## Systems Development in the Context of Data Science and Analytics

You're probably familiar with terms like "data science," "analytics," and "machine learning," especially if you've ventured into Python programming. Well, guess what? These domains are increasingly intertwined with systems development. Imagine a retail company wants to predict stock demand. A data scientist could build the predictive model, but without a system to integrate this model into the stock management software, the model is like a car without wheels—pretty much stationary.
